 Chicago, IL - Last week, the Illinois Supreme Court refused to undermine the
Illinois Biometric Privacy Act (BIPA), a decision supported by Lucy Parsons
Labs in our [amicus
brief](https://www.eff.org/document/2018-07-05-rosenbach-v-six-flags-amicus-brief-privacy-groups).
BIPA protects biometric data and is one of the most robust privacy laws in the
country–which is why companies like Facebook and Google have been aggressively
[lobbying](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17218756/facebook-biometric-privacy-lobbying-bipa-illinois)
against it. In spite of that pressure, on January 25 of this year the State
Supreme Court held that an individual can sue a private business for collecting
their biometric data without their informed consent.

BIPA was enacted over a decade ago, as a reaction to the increasing collection
and use of biometric information. Under BIPA, if a business wants to collect
someone’s biometrics, the business must obtain written consent beforehand. BIPA
also allows individuals to sue businesses that violate the law. However, until
last week, it was unclear whether a technical violation of the statute could
trigger a lawsuit. Those hoping to undermine BIPA argued that an individual
bringing a claim under the law needed to prove not only a violation of their
statutory right to control their data, but also an injury resulting from that
violation.

In 2014, Alexander Rosenbach, a minor, bought a season pass to Six Flags Great
America. Six Flags fingerprinted Rosenbach, without his or his parents’ informed
consent. When the family sued Six Flags under BIPA, Six Flags challenged the
grounds of their suit. They argued that, aside from violating his statutory
rights, they hadn’t actually injured Alex. Merely violating BIPA, they argued,
wasn’t enough for a lawsuit. The Supreme Court disagreed— holding that merely
violating BIPA was injury enough.

Lucy Parsons Labs joined a ‘friend of the court’ brief alongside the [Electronic
Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/), [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/),
[CDT](https://cdt.org/), [PIRG](https://illinoispirgedfund.org/) and the
[Chicago Alliance Against Sexual Exploitation](http://caase.org/). We argued
that because collecting biometrics without consent is a harm under BIPA, suing
for damages is appropriate.

Much of the court’s decision looked to the legislature’s intent in enacting
BIPA. Citing _Patel v. Facebook Inc._, a similar case pending in the 9th Circuit,
the court argued that “when a private entity fails to adhere to [BIPA’s]
statutory procedures,” an individual shouldn’t have to show any harm beyond the
violation. In violating BIPA, “the precise harm the Illinois legislature sought
to prevent is...realized.” The court held that violating BIPA means more
than violating a mere technicality, it means violating someone’s “right to
control their biometric information”. The legislature intended, the court
reasoned, for individuals to be able to file suit to protect that right.

In the preamble to BIPA, the legislature appreciated that BIPA would protect
“public welfare, security, and safety.” But they conceded that “the full
ramifications of biometric technology are not fully known.” A decade after
BIPA's enactment, those ramifications are still not fully known, but the
legislature's unease was prescient. As our brief argued, banks’, shopping
malls’, or the police’s use of biometrics are not necessarily benign. To make
matters worse, biometric technology is notoriously

and often

With last week’s ruling, there are more robust safeguards in place to protect
against these dangers. In the wake of Rosenbach, Lucy Parsons Lab expects more
lawsuits in Illinois demanding respect for privacy. Alongside these suits, we
also expect tech companies to ramp up their lobbying efforts, in order to
prevent [similar
laws](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/technology/california-online-privacy-law.html)
nationwide. As this fight continues, Lucy Parsons Labs will continue to advocate
for privacy, in all its forms.
